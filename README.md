## Elaine Archbold Full Stack Milestone Project

For this project, I created a website for Alio Prints which is a graphic design business I started a few years ago.

## UX
My goal in the design was to create a very user friendly site where users could view and order their own custom print.

I kept the Navbar and footer simple, and the colour theme is subtle. 

*User A – 
*User B – 
*User C - 
*User D - 
The site can be viewed through Heroku: 

I created Wireframes of how I wanted the site to look before starting. See below:

## Testing
LINKS – I have tested all links. The Instagram, YouTube and Facebook links in the footer go the relevant accounts. I have set up EmailJS for the email link in the footer.

I used Google Developer Tools to check the responsiveness of the site. The navbar and footer are responsive and reduce on smaller screens. I have used media queries throughout to allow for better UX on mobile devices.

The site had been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

All HTML was checked on the W3C Mark-up Validation Service.

The CSS was checked on the W3C CSS Validation Service.

All HTML was formatted on https://freeformatter.com.

Screenshots of the responsive design can be seen here:
